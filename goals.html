          I can't wait to start G School and learn more about full stack <!--
          -->development! I'm fascinated by the rabbit hole of CSS <!--
          -->styling, love creating simple javascript algorithms, and can't wait <!--
          -->to learn more (especially back-end, which <!--
          -->I haven't explored yet). I'm also so excited to be in an environment <!--
          -->surrounded experienced coders and to pair program with other <!--
          -->aspiring developers.

        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <div class="text">
          After G School I want to start my career at a smaller company <!--
          -->in Denver or Boulder as a junior front-end developer. <!--
          -->I want to continue to learn and grow for the <!--
          -->rest of my career, and I think a smaller company with fewer <!--
          -->developers will provide the right challenge and versatility to <!--
          -->encourage that growth! After a few years' <!--
          -->experience I want to work my way up to being a senior developer, <!--
          -->perhaps at a larger company.

        <h2>Dreams</h2>
        <div class="text">
          I would love to work for a travel company, especially a company <!--
          -->that makes travel more convenient for people on a budget! I also <!--
          -->want to incorporate music and coding together someday, in a way <!--
          -->that could benefit the classical music community and provide <!--
          -->more exposure to new generations.
